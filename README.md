SABR volatility surface calibration

This repository is the Binary.com's implementation of SABR VolSurface Calibration algorithm (Note that this is not the same as Standard SABR).

Basically a Volatility Surface Calibration algorithm tries to check a Vol-Surface to make sure it satisfies some basic requirements. If not, it will change the surface to make it a valid VolSurface. 

To read more about how this algorithm works please refer to "SABR\_RMG\_Implementation.pdf" file in the "/doc" directory.
